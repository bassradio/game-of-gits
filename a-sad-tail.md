House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

I hope Joffrey doesn't die. He seems nice.

(His mom is really intense and kind of crazy though, so I'm not entirely sure
that family is entirely well adjusted.)

Joffrey thought it would be a good idea to get a job, so that he could become independent.

Joffrey really cleaned up his life. He now works with disadvantaged youth in
Boston, Mass and has a beautiful wife and three kids.
